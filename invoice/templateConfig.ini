## Specify how to set the search filter:
## Some possible keywords are:
# - ALL -> No filter, get all mails
# - UNSEEN -> Only get unseen mails
# - SEEN -> Only get seen mails
# - FROM -> Filter by sender address: FROM "some@email.com"
# Chain filter keywords together with AND (A AND B) or OR (OR A B). Parenthesis are optional, but may help the filtering 
# As an example the following rule as text and as filter: 
# Text: only UNSEEN mails and FROM either some@email.com OR FROM some@other-email.com: 
# Filter:: UNSEEN OR (FROM some@email.com) (FROM some@other-email.com)) 
# See https://gist.github.com/martinrusev/6121028 for a list of all available keywords.
